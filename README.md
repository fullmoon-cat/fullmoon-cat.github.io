## About Me
I'm currently in my fourth year at Stanford University pursuing my BS in computer science (theory) and MS in electrical engineering (hardware & software systems). Taking advantage of the abundant undergraduate research opportunities and becoming a section leader are the two best things I've done at Stanford. I want to be doing research and teaching for a long time in my life.

I'm currently working on research in computer architecture formal verification and being a course assistant for CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing.

## Research
I've tried out a few different research projects since my frosh year. I'm grateful for all of my mentors and peers who supported me in this journey of exploration.

**Synthesizing formal execution contracts from RTL design** \
I currently work in the [Stanford High Assurance Computer Architectures Lab](https://trippel-lab.stanford.edu/) mentored by [Prof. Caroline Trippel](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/trippel/) and [Yao Hsiao](https://web.stanford.edu/~yaohsiao/). We are interested in developing a method to automatically synthesize formal speculative execution contracts from processor designs. \

**Applications of formal explanations of neural networks** \
I worked under the mentorship of [Prof. Clark Barrett](https://theory.stanford.edu/~barrett/) and [Dr. Min Wu](https://profiles.stanford.edu/276567) to explore applications of formal explanations generated by VeriX, such detecting incorrect network predictions, out-of-distribution inputs, and malicious inputs. \

**Identifying cell type specific markers in mouse cochlea** \
I worked in [Dr. Alan Cheng's Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/achenglab.html) under the guidance of Sara Billings. I used R to process single-cell RNA sequencing data and identified novel gene markers for different cell types in regenerated mouse cochlea. \
