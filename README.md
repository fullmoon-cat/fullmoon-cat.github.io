## About Me
I'm currently in my fourth year at Stanford University pursuing my BS in computer science (theory) and MS in electrical engineering (hardware & software systems). Taking advantage of the abundant undergraduate research opportunities and becoming a section leader are the two best things I've done at Stanford. I want to be doing research and teaching for a long time in my life.

I'm currently working on research in computer architecture formal verification and being a course assistant for CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing.

## Research
I've tried out a few different research projects since my frosh year. I'm grateful for all of my mentors and peers who supported me in this journey of exploration.

**Synthesizing formal execution contracts from RTL design**

**Applications of formal explanations of neural networks**

**Identifying cell type specific markers in mouse cochlea** \
I worked in [Dr. Cheng's Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/achenglab.html) under the guidance of Sara Billings. I used R to process single-cell RNA sequencing data and identified novel gene markers for different cell types in regenerated mouse cochlea. [\[Poster\]](/assets/posters/scRNA_seq_poster.pdf)
