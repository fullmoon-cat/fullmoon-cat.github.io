## About Me
I'm currently in my fourth year at Stanford University pursuing my BS in computer science (theory) and MS in electrical engineering (hardware & software systems). Taking advantage of the abundant undergraduate research opportunities and becoming a section leader are the two best things I've done at Stanford. I want to be doing research and teaching for a long time in my life.
